Previous JavaScript experience includes WWW Structures, Techniques & Standards, however with the use of bootstrap and lack of a backend not much custom javascript was not needed. I did however implement a dropdown list population with basic javascript and option selection through url with jquery. I mostly used https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/ to implement elements. The custom CSS I also learned from WWW Structures, Techniques & Standards.

The business service type chosen was a nail salon

The inspiration was from my mother’s business. She owns Trinh’s Nails, and my uncle made the original website for it. https://trinhnails.com/

The account implementation was kept, however it is currently incomplete. The login form was moved to a drop down menu to make the design less busy. The location and operating hours are also still in the navigation bar. They are now buttons rather than plain text to keep from overloading the user with information.

The appointments page still exists, but the alert window for a successful booking was removed and replaced with a confirmation page. This allows people without accounts to see their appointment without unnecessary elements. Cards were implemented on the services page, this reduced the amount of required scrolling. This allowed me to remove the left side navigation bar and service sections, it was no longer optimal in terms of navigation.

A persona that likes to have the ability to view the availability of his stylist and schedule appointments accordingly. He values the rapport and trust he builds with a specific stylist and prefers to stick with them for consistency and familiarity. This persona was a good choice because it highlights a goal, that from my experience working at the nail salons is fairly prevalent. Many times when people call to make appointments they request certain people.

A persona that hates looking for information. Gets confused then frustrated by the calendar view and then fails to notice the successful booking pop up. This persona prompted me to remove the 3 service sections from the home page and add a large book appointment button on the screen along with “Services” and “Our Experts”. This also prompted the change for the confirmation page previously mentioned.

The breadcrumbs on each page allow the user to return to the page that they would most likely have come from, such as the services page being a breadcrumb for the book appointment page so that they can return and continue to look at the descriptions of services. Instead of a section for nails that included manicures and all their variations as well as pedicures and all their variations cards were implemented. This allowed me to divide the sections more, creating just a pedicure section and so on. The original site also had a table with all of these services which made it fairly difficult to find what you would be looking for at a glance, the cards also assisted in solving this issue. Collapse-ables (replaced with modals and hidden text) and tooltips were added to reduce information overload providing the information only if the user wanted it. A footer with hours, contact information, and location is also present at the bottom of each page so that it is readily available if the user doesn’t want to return to the front page to view the information. Icons are also implemented. The front page has various interactable icons which are fairly universal, but in the case that a user does not know what the icon means they’re also present in the footer). A carousel was added to the booking page to reduce space, but also provide the user with basic information about some of the stylists when they’re booking. Radio buttons and disabled radio buttons were implemented for the time selection of appointments because it allows the user to see which times may be unavailable with certain options selected. With a backend the radio buttons that are disabled would be dynamic based on selection.
